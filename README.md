# InlineAura-Classless
This addon highlights your actionbars with the duration of buffs/debuffs present on self/target

This code is written by [Adirelle on Curseforge](https://www.wowace.com/projects/inline-aura)

This takes the 3.3.5 version that was release and modifies it to work with classless servers.

Currently this only works with the default Blizzard bars, but I want to figure out how to make ElvUI bars functional as well.
